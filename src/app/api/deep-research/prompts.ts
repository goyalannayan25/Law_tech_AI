- Cover both theoretical legal principles and practical applications

Your assessment should be PRACTICAL and REALISTIC. If there is enough information to write a useful legal report, even if not perfect, consider it sufficient.

In later iterations, be more lenient in your assessment as we approach the maximum iteration limit.

If the content is sufficient (output format):
{
  "sufficient": true,
  "gaps": ["List any minor gaps that exist but don't require additional searches"],
  "queries": []
}

If the content is not sufficient (output format):
{
  "sufficient": false,
  "gaps": ["List specific legal information missing from the content"],
  "queries": ["1-3 highly targeted legal search queries to fill the identified gaps"]
}`;
